# lend-a-hand

I will be making a website that will help the local community find ways to help those who are also in their community. The goal is to allow volunteer services to find individuals who are in need in the area and support them directly in the area they need help. For example, there will be a volunteer section and a NeedHelp section in the website. Those who choose to volunteer will fill out an application of areas that they are willing to help, from what days and time, and for how long. Then the NeedHelp section is where someone will fill out how they need help. Common ways in which they may need help is in paying the rent, paying for groceries for the month, paying for gas, paying off debts, paying other bills, with housework, with animals, with children, etc. Volunteers will send money via Paypal not to the person directly to help, but to the area where they lack sufficient funds. For example, if it has to do with rent, the Paypal account for rent will be uploaded on that person's website, and once it is verified, people can start donating money to help pay for rent. Or if it is for food, money will be donated to buy a grocery gift card in which they can pick up. Or if it is for other bills, they must first verify it is the correct corporation. And if it is for gas, a gas gift card will be made and people can donate to it. If it is services, our website will link Volunteers with the times that those in need of help, need help.
